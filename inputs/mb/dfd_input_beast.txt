# data file for loading information into dlib based dnn projects
# '#' are used for comments and will not be read in by the parser
# Version 2.5
# The file is organized in the following manner:
# Version (std::string): version name for named saving of various files 
# Stopping Criteria (uint64_t, uint64_t) [stop time (hrs), max one step] 
# training_file (std::string): This file contains a list of images and labels used for training
# test_file (std::string): This file contains a list of images and labels used for testing
# crop_num (uint64_t): The number of crops to use when using a random cropper
# crop_size (uint64_t, uint64_t): This is the height and width of the crop size
#           For v7 and v8 (3x3, 3x3, 3x3 down, 4x4, 4x4, 4x4 up) - min 30,30 increments of 16
#           For v9 (5x5, 5x5, 5x5 down, 6x6, 6x6, 6x6 up) - min 44,44 increments of 16
# filter_num (uint64_t...): This is the number of filters per layer.  Should be a comma separated list, eg. 10,20,30
#             if the list does not account for the entire network then the code only uses what is available
#             and leaves the remaining filter number whatever the default value was.  The order of the filters
#             goes from outer most to the inner most layer.
