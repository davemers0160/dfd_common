# data file for loading information into dlib based dnn projects
# '#' are used for comments and will not be read in by the parser
# The file is organized in the following manner
# training_file: This file contains a list of images and labels used for training
# test_file: This file contains a list of images and labels used for testing
# crop_num: The number of crops to use when using a random cropper
# crop_size: This is the height and width of the crop size.  Should be a comma separated list, eg. 20,20
# filter_num: This is the number of filters per layer.  Should be a comma separated list, eg. 10,20,30
#             if the list does not account for the entire network then the code only uses what is available
#             and leaves the remaining filter number whatever the default value was.  The order of the filters
#             goes from outer most to the inner most layer.
